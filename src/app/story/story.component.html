          Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance against
          criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha
          as a child, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice. He trains
          himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona,
          and monitors the Gotham streets at night.
